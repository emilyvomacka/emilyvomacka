I've worked on maps software throughout the stack, focusing on fuel-efficient routing.

Interested in systems spelunking, cryptography, music theory, and thoughtful design wherever I find it.

2024 [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) participant, where I built a [small-scale, stochastically-driven database](https://github.com/emilyvomacka/lost-and-safe). Seattle -> NYC.
